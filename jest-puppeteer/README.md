Tests are run with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

There exists a [jest-puppeteer](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer) project to join the two, but it broke on some tests.

Luckily, there is also some [documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer#custom-example-without-jest-puppeteer-preset) for linking the two ourselves. This folder contains the code copied from that documentation (and then possibly modified).
